                <p>The personal statement might just be the hardest part of your college application. Mostly this is
                    because it has the least guidance and is the most open-ended. One way to understand what colleges
                    are looking for when they ask you to write an essay is to check out the essays of students who
                    already got in—college essays that actually worked. After all, they must be among the most
                    successful of this weird literary genre.

                    In this article, I'll go through general guidelines for what makes great college essays great. I've
                    also compiled an enormous list of 100+ actual sample college essays from 11 different schools.
                    Finally, I'll break down two of these published college essay examples and explain why and how they
                    work. With links to 145 full essays and essay excerpts, this article will be a great resource for
                    learning how to craft your own personal college admissions essay!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Building out from a narrow, concrete focus. You'll see a similar structure in many of the essays. The
                    author starts with a very detailed story of an event or description of a person or place. After this
                    sense-heavy imagery, the essay expands out to make a broader point about the author, and connects
                    this very memorable experience to the author's present situation, state of mind, newfound
                    understanding, or maturity level.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Knowing how to tell a story. Some of the experiences in these essays are one-of-a-kind. But most deal
                    with the stuff of everyday life. What sets them apart is the way the author approaches the topic:
                    analyzing it for drama and humor, for its moving qualities, for what it says about the author's
                    world, and for how it connects to the author's emotional life.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A killer first sentence. You've heard it before, and you'll hear it again: you have to suck the
                    reader in, and the best place to do that is the first sentence. Great first sentences are punchy.
                    They are like cliffhangers, setting up an exciting scene or an unusual situation with an unclear
                    conclusion, in order to make the reader want to know more. Don't take my word for it—check out these
                    22 first sentences from Stanford applicants and tell me you don't want to read the rest of those
                    essays to find out what happens!

                    A lively, individual voice. Writing is for readers. In this case, your reader is an admissions
                    officer who has read thousands of essays before yours and will read thousands after. Your goal?
                    Don't bore your reader. Use interesting descriptions, stay away from clichés, include your own
                    offbeat observations—anything that makes this essay sounds like you and not like anyone else.</p>
